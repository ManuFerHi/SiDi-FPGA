The intent for this core is to be a 1:1 playable implementation of ["Prehistoric Isle in 1930" SNK M68000 hardware](http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=888&gid=18603#18603).

This core is in active development by [Darren Olafson](https://twitter.com/Darren__O) with assistance from [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17).

FPGA implementation is loosely based on MAME source and will be verified against an authentic SNK Prehistoric Isle in 1930 PCB.
Please support the original author via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/darreno), it's greatly appreciated.

MiST port, new SDRAM controller, clocking and other fixes, graphics rewrite by [Gyorgy Szombathelyi](https://github.com/gyurco) and [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock).
