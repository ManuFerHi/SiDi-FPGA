### Apple //e for MiST

This the MiST/SiDi port of a reconstruction of an 1980s-era Apple//e (enhanced),
based on the Apple ][+ implemented in VHDL for FPGAs.
* Original for the DE2: http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/apple2fpga/
* Port for the MiST: http://ws0.org/tag/apple2/
* Current [source code](https://github.com/gyurco/apple2efpga) on GitHub

Features:
- 6502 or 65C02 CPU
- disk loading via OSD (read/write support)
- joystick support
- tape input from the UART RX pin
- 15kHz TV and 30kHz VGA support (optional YPbPr output)
- scanlines
- color, amber, green and black&white monitor
- 64k auxilary memory with 80 column card in Slot 3
- Mockingboard model A (two AY-3-8913 chips for six audio channels) in slot 4
- CFFA 2.0 compatible IDE interface in slot 7
- Super Serial Card in slot 2

On the "Apple II/e" boot screen open the OSD with F12 and choose a nibblelized disk. It will boot
the disk automatically. Use dsk2nib to convert AppleII disk images to .nib images.

If you press reset (the right button on the MiST/SiDi128) you'll enter Applesoft with the ] prompt.
From here you have some limited commands. See: http://www.landsnail.com/a2ref.htm.
If you want to boot another disk choose a .nib image via the OSD and choose Cold Reset.

The CFFA IDE interface uses appleII.hd0 as master IDE drive and appleII.hd1 as slave.
