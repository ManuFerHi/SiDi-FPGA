# Installation #

Copy the `*`.rbf file at the root of the SD card.
You can rename the file to core.rbf if you want the MiST to load it automatically at startup.

Roms can be copied anywhere on the SD card and are selected via the OSD menu.
If you have many files you might want to store them into alphabetized sub-folders to access them more quickly.

On SiDi128, System E games can be played by creating ARC and ROM files using the MRA tool.
For System E, the required firmware is at least 250921! The core name must be SMS.RBF.
